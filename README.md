# Dot Matrix Display with 8086 Microprocessor

This project demonstrates how to interface an **8086 microprocessor** with a **dot matrix display** in Proteus to sequentially show all **English alphabet characters (A–Z)** in capital form.

## 🔧 Features
- Circuit design in **Proteus** for dot matrix interfacing with 8086.
- Assembly code to display each capital letter one by one.
- Demonstrates microprocessor-level control of peripheral devices.

## 🖥️ Tools & Software
- **Proteus** (for circuit simulation)
- **8086 Assembly Language**
- **MASM / TASM** (assembler for code, if testing outside Proteus)

## 📂 Project Structure
- `circuit/` → Proteus design files (`.dsn`)
- `code/` → 8086 Assembly source code (`.asm`)
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.dsn` file in **Proteus**.
2. Load the compiled assembly code (`.hex`/`.bin`) into the 8086 microprocessor.
3. Run the simulation.
4. Watch the **dot matrix** display all letters (A–Z) sequentially.

## 📷 Demo
*(Insert screenshot or GIF of the simulation here if available)*

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Add scrolling text support.
- Display custom characters or symbols.
- Extend to multi-matrix display for words.
